\title{Reduce dialects and other duplicates which have the same glottcode in dataframe to one per language, and give it the glottocode of the parent that is at level language. Requires a cldf-value table and language-table. Simplifies combination of dataset.}
\usage{
language_level_df(
  ValueTable,
  LanguageTable,
  method = c("singular_least_missing_data", "combine_random", "singular_random"),
  drop_question_marks = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ValueTable}{data-frame, long format. ValueTable from cldf.}

\item{LanguageTable}{data-frame of a cldf LanguageTable. Needs to have columns Glottocode and Language_ID or Language_level_ID.}

\item{method}{character vector, choice between "singular_least_missing_data", "combine_random", "singular_random". combine_random = combine all datapoints for all the dialects/duplicates and if there is more than one datapoint for a given feature/word/variable choose randomly between them, singular_random = choose randomly between the dialects/duplicates, singular_least_missing_data = choose the dialect/duplicate which has the most datapoints.}
}
\value{
data-frame of ValueTable without duplicates
}

Reduce dialects and other duplicates which have the same glottcode in dataframe to one per language, and give it the glottocode of the parent that is at level language. Requires a cldf-value table and language-table. Simplifies combination of dataset.
